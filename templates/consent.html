                    <font color="green" > Overview of the study:  </font> <BR>

		We are requesting your participation in a study regarding the extent in which a user’s perception of trust evolves whilst utilising a particular ICT platform. This study should last 			approximately 45 minutes. You will be asked to take part in a brief online trust exercise (a sociological experiment) and fill out a short questionnaire. Personal information will not 		be released or viewed by anyone other than researchers involved in this project.  A debriefing statement will be given to you upon completion of the study.<BR><BR>

		 <font color="green" > Who are we? </font> <BR>

		We are an interdisciplinary research group that is part of European project examining trust in the digital age. Our team members are: Costas Kalogiros and Michalis Kanakakis – from the 			Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), Greece; Shenja van der Graaf and Wim Vanobberghen – from iMinds, Belgium; and, Sophie Stalla-Bourdillon and Laura German – from the 		University of Southampton, UK. <BR><BR>

		<font color="green" >Confidentiality </font> <BR>

		Any information you give will be kept completely confidential and in no cases will responses from individual participants be identified. As with any piece of research it is important to 			consider whether there are any risks to participants. The study involves minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). There may be no direct benefit 			to you other than the sense of helping the public at large and contributing to knowledge.<BR>

		The server running the experiment is based at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). Participants should be aware, however, that the experiment is not being run from a 			'secure' https server of the kind typically used to handle credit card transactions, so there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by unauthorised third parties (e.g., 			computer hackers). However, the data would appear only as a string of numbers, so your responses will remain totally anonymous.<BR>

		The data collected from this online study will be stored and managed by the project members based at AUEB.<BR><BR>

 		<font color="green" > Publication </font> <BR>

		All responses are treated as confidential, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. Rather, all data will be pooled and published in aggregate form 			only. The results from this study will be made publically available (on the Web) through a project report, and may potentially be used for other research purposes, such as conference 			and journal publications.<BR><BR>

		<font color="green" > Withdrawal from study </font> <BR>

		Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled, and participants may withdraw from 			the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.<BR><BR>

		<font color="green" > Monetary compensation </font> <BR>

		Visitors to this web site are welcome to complete the study. Participants who successfully completed the experiment will receive a fixed payment of $1. Furthermore, participants whose 		average trust levels after the last trial is closer to their group average will receive a bonus of $10.<BR><BR>

		<font color="green" > Ethics approval </font> <BR>

		This study yet to be approved by the University of Southampton’s Faculty of Business and Law Ethics Board in June/July 2015 – ERGO ID no: 15978.<BR><BR>
