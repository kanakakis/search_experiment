		We are requesting your participation in a study regarding the extent in which a userâ€™s perception of trust evolves whilst utilising a particular Internet service. This study should last 			approximately 40 minutes. You will be asked to take part in a brief online trust exercise (a sociological experiment) and fill out a short questionnaire. Finally, a debriefing statement 			will be given to you upon completion of the study.<BR><BR>

		 <font color="green" > Who are we? </font> <BR>

		We are an interdisciplinary research group that is part of the European project OPTET (http://www.optet.eu/) examining trust in the digital age.  <BR><BR>

		<font color="green" >Confidentiality </font> <BR>


		Any information you give will be kept completely confidential and in no cases will responses from individual participants be identified. The study involves minimal risk to participants 			(i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). <BR>
		
		The server running the experiment is based at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). AUEB is responsible for managing the data collected via this study. The primary study 		data collected will be accessible to OPTET project members (primarily) based at AUEB (Greece), iMinds (Belgium) and University of Southampton (UK). Participants should be aware, 			however, that the experiment is not being run from a 'secure' https server of the kind typically used to handle credit card transactions, so there is a small possibility that responses 			could be viewed by unauthorised third parties (e.g., computer hackers). However, the data would appear only as a string of numbers, so your responses will remain totally 			anonymous.<BR><BR>

		

		<font color="green" > Withdrawal from study </font> <BR>

		Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled, and participants may withdraw from 			the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.<BR><BR>
