		  <B> A) The design of this online study </B> <BR>
			This online study is split into two parts: 1) an ACME Search Engine exercise; and, 2) a questionnaire.<BR><BR>

			Please set aside at least 40 minutes of your time to complete this study.<BR>
			<B> You must complete and submit your entire responses to this study in one continuous session. </B> <BR>
			You will not be able to save your progress and return to this online study at a later time. Whilst the estimated time for completing this study is around 40 minutes, if not 				completed within 120 minutes your session will time-out. If you are unable to complete the study within the allotted time, you can start a new session from the beginning, but 				none of your progress from the previous session will be saved. You will only be able to complete this study once.<BR><BR>

		  <B> B) Part one: The interactive ACME search engine exercise</B><BR>
			The scenario:<BR>
			You are planning a surprise birthday party and need to find a set of ten (10) items, such as a bespoke birthday cake. You will use the fictional ACME search engine to attempt to 				locate these items. Additionally, you will use the ACME search engine to perform a couple of more queries for a side-project. Thus this exercise consists of twelve (12) trials, 				one for each action item in the following to-do list. <BR>

		<font color="green" >The search keywords</font><BR>
		The keywords that you input into the ACME search engine are already pre-defined in accordance with each scenario. Therefore, all you have to do is press the search button. You cannot 			input any of your own keywords into the search bar.<BR><BR>

		
		<font color="green" > The search results </font><BR>
		A list of search results (delivered by the ACME search engine) will appear when you press the search button. These search results will appear in a list form. These search results will 		not look like normal search results i.e. there are no links to websites or descriptions provided. <BR><BR>
