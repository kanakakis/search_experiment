					    	Your participation was extremely valuable. It has been acknowledged that you are very busy and we really appreciate the time you devoted to participating 							in this study. 

						It is very important that you do not discuss this study with anyone else until the study is complete. Our efforts will be greatly compromised if 							participants come into this study knowing what is about and how the ideas are being tested. Once again results of this study will not include your name 						or any other identifying characteristics.
